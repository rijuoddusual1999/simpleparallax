Hii everyone, I made this very simple parallax effect using **react-spring** library which uses physics instead of duration, timeframes in vanilla JS. 

You can clone this repo and run this on your local machine by the following steps:

1. Git clone **git@github.com:rijuoddusual1999/simpleparallax.git**

2. Move to the project directory and download dependencies via **npm install**

3. Host the project on your local machine, by running **npm run dev**

Run all the above steps in the terminal of your favourite code editor.
